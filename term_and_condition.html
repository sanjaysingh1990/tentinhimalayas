                        href="mailto:tentinhimalayas@gmail.com">tentinhimalayas@gmail.com</a> . Our consultants will help you to select the travel arrangements that you require and will offer you a price for these arrangements. Your booking
                    with TentInHimalayas is confirmed when we have received your deposit for the arrangements that you have confirmed by email or by phone with our staff and agents. If you are making a booking for more than one person, the person confirming
                    the booking must have the consent of other accompanying guests to make the booking on their behalf and this person will be responsible for all payments for all guests travelling on the booking. For the purposes of our booking conditions

                </p>
                <p>We make every reasonable effort to ensure that any written or oral instructions provided to us are accurately reflected in the documentation we provide to our clients and on which a booking is based. Please check the information we send
                    you to ensure that it is accurate and reflects the instructions you have given us. We cannot be responsible for any errors that may result from an inaccuracy in our documentation that is not notified to us by email within 10 days of
                    it being sent to you and on which you may book your arrangements or amend them.</p>

                <h4>Rates</h4>
                <p>The rates for your TentInHimalayas programme will be based upon our published tariff. The rates for supporting arrangements prior to or post the TentInHimalayas programme that you book will be based upon the rates available to us at the
                    time of booking. Rates that are quoted to you for non TentInHimalayas services which we purchase through agents and trusted partners will be valid for 7 days from the date they are issued and should be confirmed within this period.</p>
                <p>Once you have made a booking with TentInHimalayas and paid your deposit there will be no change to your price except where the Government of India impose any new taxes on travel and travel suppliers and such a change is greater than 2%
                    of your total arrangements booked with the company.</p>

                <p>75% of the total booking is to be received 120 days prior to the commencement of your arrangements booked with us. Non receipt of final payment by the due date will be treated as a cancellation and relevant cancellation charges will apply.</p>

                <h4>About You – Medical Information and Special Requests</h4>
                <p>It is necessary for you to inform us about any medical condition, dietary requirement or special requirements that may have a significant or material impact on your ability to enjoy your booked arrangements. These should be advised to
                    us at the time of booking and whilst we may be able to accommodate special requests and requirements we cannot be responsible for any loss of enjoyment that may arise from your failure to communicate these issues at the time of booking.
                    Some of the areas in which operate are very remote, with limited medical facilities and as such we reserve the right to refuse a booking where a medical condition may impair your ability to enjoy or fulfill your travel arrangements.
                    TentInHimalayas will not be responsible for any curtailment or amendment to travel arrangements that result from a medical condition either pre-existing or occurring during your travel arrangements.</p>

                <h4>Changes to your booking</h4>
                <p>Once you have booked your travel arrangements with us, changes you may wish to make to your booked arrangements after receipt of your deposit will be possible subject to any charges that may be made by our suppliers. Any change that requires
                    an alteration of dates to any booking, including postponement may be treated as a cancellation and our cancellation policy applied depending upon the notice given prior to arrival.</p>
                <p>In the event that your arrangements need to be changed as a result of a missed, delayed or cancelled international or domestic airline flight, car or rail journey we will provide every assistance to you to make the required changes to
                    your travel arrangements, but you will be responsible for the cost of such changes.</p>
                <p>Where your arrangements need to be changed, curtailed or abandoned due to circumstances beyond the control of TentInHimalayas , including but not limited to acts of god, civil commotion, strikes, war, threat of war, terrorist activity
                    either threatened or actual, natural or nuclear disaster and events beyond the reasonable control of TentInHimalayas, we will, depending upon whether you are in the country or due to travel, either make alternate arrangements or offer
                    you alternate travel arrangements where available. If such events occur whilst you are already travelling in India the costs of such arrangements will be borne by you. TentInHimalayas is regrettably unable to pay compensation or take
                    responsibility for any costs, losses and liabilities that may result from such events, where they affect the ability of TentInHimalayas to promptly and efficiently deliver its contracted arrangements to you or such events give rise
                    to personal loss, distress, injury, or death.</p>

                <h4>Complaints and problems</h4>
                <p>In the event that you have any reason to complain or experience any problems with your travel arrangements whilst you are in India you must immediately inform your guide, house manager or one of our Delhi staff, so that we can attend to
                    any service issue that may arise and promptly rectify it. If you wish to complain about an aspect of our service after you have left India this should be communicated to us in writing within 21 days of your departure from India. Where
                    any complaint arises from services not wholly owned or operated by TentInHimalayas we will use our best endeavours to address the issue with the relevant supplier during your stay in India. However TentInHimalayas is unable to accept
                    responsibility or liability for failures and omissions of its suppliers where it neither owns, manages or controls such suppliers. We do however exercise care and attention when selecting and promoting the services of third parties
                    to support your travel arrangements. However any assistance provided by TentInHimalayas in resolving a complaint in relation to any arrangements provided by suppliers to TentInHimalayas is provided on a goodwill basis and in its capacity

                    any such damage or loss must be paid to TentInHimalayas or its suppliers upon request. TentInHimalayas reserve the right to terminate your stay or that of any person travelling with you due to threatening behavior, moral turpitude
                    or conduct which in TentInHimalayas’s reasonable opinion justifies termination of your travel arrangements and in the event of such termination no refunds will be given. TentInHimalayas will not be under any obligation whatsoever to
                    pay compensation or meet any costs or expenses you may incur as a result of your stay being terminated.</p>
