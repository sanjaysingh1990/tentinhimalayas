## Technical Implementation Details

### Page Transition System
The enhanced page transition system works by:
1. Intercepting clicks on internal navigation links (.html files)
2. Adding visual feedback to the clicked link
3. Applying exit animations to the current page content
4. Navigating to the new page after the animation completes

### CSS Animations
Key CSS animations include:
- Page entrance: Fade in with slight upward movement
- Page exit: Fade out with upward movement and scaling
- Navigation links: Animated underline effect on hover
- Preloader: Spinning wheel with pulsing text

### JavaScript Functions
