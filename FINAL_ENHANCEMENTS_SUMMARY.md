```css

    position: relative;
    transition: all 0.3s ease;
}

.rd-navbar-nav a::after {
    content: '';
    position: absolute;
    bottom: -5px;
    left: 50%;
    width: 0;
    height: 2px;

}
```

#### JavaScript Page Transition Handler
```javascript
function initEnhancedPageTransitions() {
    $("a[href$='.html']").not('[target="_blank"]').on('click', function(e) {
        // Prevent default navigation
        // Add visual feedback
